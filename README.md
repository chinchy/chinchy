<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ilia Petrov</h1>

I am a Python backend developer with <b>5+</b> years of experience in web-oriented projects. Programming is like
building Lego when I can design systems with big blocks or write code with small ones.

<ul>
  <li>I increased document production speed by <b>50%</b> with <b>Flask</b> and decreased <b>PostgreSQL</b> usage rate by 2+ times
with event-driven architecture and Redis.</li>
  <li>As the <b>lead</b>, managed a crew with 3 members, gathered requirements, designed and implemented features with
<b>FastAPI</b>, <b>Kafka</b>, and <b>ClickHouse</b>.</li>
  <li>Thanks to the backend developed with Selenium and SOAP protocol <b>on my own</b> for 3 months, the project
was launched in time.</li>
  <li>I utilized my <b>open mind</b> and <b>sociability</b> by conducting 10+ interviews, onboarding, and mentoring several
developers.</li>
</ul>

I want to work in a product company and develop things that help make life easier. I would happily work with new
technologies like the Python framework <b>Sanic</b> and know more about <b>DevOps</b> tools and practices like <b>Terraform</b>.
